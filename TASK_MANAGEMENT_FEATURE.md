## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure

**Task with Submissions:**
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  status: 'open' | 'in_progress' | 'submitted' | 'completed';
  assignedTo?: string;
  assignedToName?: string;
  submissions: [
    {
      id: string;
      userId: string;
      userName: string;
      content: string;
      attachments: string[];
      status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected';
      reviewComment?: string;
      createdAt: number;
    }
  ];
  xpReward?: number;
  deadline?: number;
  priority?: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'urgent';
}
```

**Chat Messages:**
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  contextType: 'task';
  contextId: string; // task ID
  userId: string;
  userName: string;
  content: string;
  createdAt: number;
}
```

### Firebase Paths
- Tasks: `/tasks/{startupId}/{taskId}`
- Task Chats: `/taskChats/{taskId}/{messageId}`
- User XP: `/users/{userId}/xp`
- User Tasks Completed: `/users/{userId}/tasksCompleted`

### Real-time Updates
- Chat messages use Firebase `onValue` listener for real-time updates
- Submissions update automatically when founder reviews
- Task status changes reflect immediately

## Benefits

1. **Transparency:** All work submissions are timestamped and permanent
2. **Trust Building:** Contributors build reputation through completed tasks
3. **Communication:** Built-in chat reduces friction
4. **Gamification:** XP rewards motivate quality work
5. **Accountability:** Clear review process with feedback
6. **Simplicity:** Everything in one dialog - no context switching

## Next Steps

Future enhancements could include:
- File upload support (not just links)
- Task templates for common work types
- Automated deadline reminders
- Task difficulty ratings
- Skill-based task recommendations
- Submission versioning (revisions)
- Multi-reviewer support
- Task analytics dashboard
